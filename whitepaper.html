        <h2>1. Introduction: The Optimization Assumption</h2>
        
        <p>Most adaptive systems are built on an implicit premise: adaptation requires optimization. The system must define a target, measure deviation, and tune behavior toward an improved outcome.</p>
        
        <p>This premise is treated as structural necessity. It is not.</p>
        
        <p>Optimization is a specific class of operation: it selects, ranks, and steers trajectories toward preferred states under an objective. Adaptation is not structurally bound to that class. Adaptation can exist as a non-steering operation: reconfiguring representation without selecting outcomes.</p>
        
        <p>This document is doctrine-layer. It defines admissible representation and categorical refusals. It does not define implementation, deployment, or use.</p>
        
        <p>The central claim of this paper is narrow and defensible:</p>
        
        <p class="core-claim">Adaptation without optimization is possible.</p>
        
        <p>The remaining sections define what exists within Baseline, what is admissible to compute, and what is explicitly refused.</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h2>2. Baselines as Reference States</h2>
        
        <p>A baseline is a reference state derived from observation under constraint.</p>
        
        <p>A baseline is defined over signals. It is not defined over intentions, motives, identities, or desired outcomes.</p>
        
        <p>Baselines exist to provide comparability. They establish what a stream resembles when it is not being acted upon by the system.</p>
        
        <p>Baselines are not forecasts.</p>
        <p>Baselines are not goals.</p>
        <p>Baselines are not targets.</p>
        <p>Baselines are not a definition of "correct" behavior.</p>
        <p>Baselines are not an instruction to return.</p>
        <p>Baselines are not a standard of improvement.</p>
        <p>Baselines are not a template for a person.</p>
        
        <p>A baseline is a boundary object: it allows independent systems to name deviation without inheriting authority to interpret meaning or assign value.</p>
        
        <p>In Baseline, a reference state is admissible only if it is representationally bounded and observationally grounded. If a reference state requires interpretive authority, it is refused.</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h2>3. Behavior Under Constraint</h2>
        
        <p>Baseline treats behavior as a stream of observable variation under finite resolution.</p>
        
        <p>Behavior, in this doctrine, means only what can be expressed as admissible signal: timing, frequency, recurrence, intensity, duration, sequence, and bounded change over time.</p>
        
        <p>Behavior is processed as structure.</p>
        <p>Behavior is not processed as intent.</p>
        <p>Behavior is not processed as identity.</p>
        <p>Behavior is not processed as psychology.</p>
        <p>Behavior is not processed as preference.</p>
        <p>Behavior is not processed as a proxy for character, compliance, risk, or worth.</p>
        
        <p>The admissible unit is the signal event and its bounded context. The inadmissible unit is the person as an inferred model.</p>
        
        <p>Baseline therefore draws a categorical boundary:</p>
        
        <p class="categorical-boundary">Behavior is admissible. Identity is not.</p>
        
        <p>This boundary is not a preference. It is a structural refusal. It defines what Baseline is allowed to represent.</p>
        
        <p>Any transformation that requires identity-level inference is out of scope by definition.</p>
        
        <p>Any transformation that attempts to convert behavior into a stable profile is out of scope by definition.</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h2>4. Adaptation Without Optimization</h2>
        
        <p>Baseline defines adaptation as structural scaffolding applied to presentation, routing, and representation of the same observed content.</p>
        
        <p>In this doctrine, "adaptation" names an admissible transformation class. It does not assert that Baseline performs transformations, nor does it prescribe when or how any system should do so.</p>
        
        <p>Adaptation is permitted only when it does not introduce an objective, a target state, or a steering signal.</p>
        
        <p>Adaptation is not permitted to select outcomes.</p>
        <p>Adaptation is not permitted to rank preferred behaviors.</p>
        <p>Adaptation is not permitted to tune the user.</p>
        <p>Adaptation is not permitted to shape the user.</p>
        <p>Adaptation is not permitted to measure "improvement."</p>
        
        <p>Scaffolding is limited to representation formats and metadata that do not alter content, rank outcomes, or condition user decisions.</p>
        
        <p>The permitted transformation class is representational:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>reparameterization without objective functions</li>
            <li>reformatting without preference ordering</li>
            <li>recontextualization without value assignment</li>
            <li>resegmentation without goal selection</li>
            <li>rescaling without optimization criteria</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Adaptation in Baseline is therefore defined by invariance:</p>
        
        <p class="core-claim">Same content. Different scaffolding.</p>
        
        <p>If a proposed adaptation changes content, inserts recommendations, prioritizes an outcome, or attempts to steer decisions, it exits the definition and is refused.</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h2>5. Observer Posture</h2>
        
        <p>Baseline distinguishes observation from influence by authority.</p>
        
        <p>Observation is the act of measuring, indexing, and representing signals under explicit limits.</p>
        
        <p>Influence is any act that asserts what should happen next, or that conditions the environment to cause a preferred outcome.</p>
        
        <p>Baseline has no authority to influence.</p>
        
        <p>Baseline does not intervene.</p>
        <p>Baseline does not instruct.</p>
        <p>Baseline does not recommend.</p>
        <p>Baseline does not prescribe.</p>
        <p>Baseline does not optimize.</p>
        <p>Baseline does not attempt to produce improvement.</p>
        
        <p>Baseline is not permitted to translate observation into action-selection, whether directly or indirectly.</p>
        
        <p>The posture is ordered:</p>
        
        <p class="tagline-internal">We observe before we adapt.</p>
        
        <p>If adaptation exists in a downstream system, it is downstream of observation and remains scaffolding-only.</p>
        
        <p>In this document, refusal is definitional: it marks operations as out of scope. No enforcement mechanism is described or implied.</p>
        
        <p>Observation is admissible only as representation. Adaptation is admissible only as scaffolding. Nothing in Baseline is permitted to cross from scaffolding into steering.</p>
        
        <p>If a system component depends on user compliance to validate itself, it is not observer-only. It is refused.</p>
        
        <p>If a system component relies on feedback to tune what it outputs toward a preferred effect, it is not non-optimizing. It is refused.</p>
        
        <p>If a system component claims to change outcomes, it is not non-authoritative. It is refused.</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h2>6. Explicit Rejections</h2>
        
        <p>Baseline explicitly does not perform the following:</p>
        
        <ul class="rejection-list">
            <li>No personalization</li>
            <li>No user profiling</li>
            <li>No identity inference</li>
            <li>No psychology inference</li>
            <li>No intent inference</li>
            <li>No preference modeling</li>
            <li>No learning styles</li>
            <li>No coaching</li>
            <li>No motivational framing</li>
            <li>No behavioral nudging</li>
            <li>No habit formation logic</li>
            <li>No persuasion mechanisms</li>
            <li>No goal selection</li>
            <li>No goal tracking</li>
            <li>No progress scoring</li>
            <li>No optimization metrics</li>
            <li>No outcome tuning</li>
            <li>No recommendation systems</li>
            <li>No intervention language</li>
            <li>No improvement claims</li>
            <li>No effectiveness claims</li>
            <li>No predictive claims</li>
            <li>No risk scoring</li>
            <li>No compliance scoring</li>
            <li>No automated decision-making</li>
            <li>No automated actions</li>
            <li>No adaptive control loops</li>
            <li>No reinforcement logic</li>
            <li>No reward shaping</li>
            <li>No penalty shaping</li>
            <li>No attempts to change the user</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Baseline also explicitly does not claim the following:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>That adaptation will improve outcomes</li>
            <li>That adaptation will increase performance</li>
            <li>That adaptation will produce well-being</li>
            <li>That adaptation will change behavior</li>
            <li>That adaptation will reduce risk</li>
            <li>That adaptation will prevent failure</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Baseline is defined to remain valid even when no positive claims can be made.</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h2>7. Implications</h2>
        
        <p>A system defined by this doctrine can represent behavioral structure without asserting meaning.</p>
        
        <p>It can create stable reference states without converting them into targets.</p>
        
        <p>It can alter scaffolding without introducing objectives.</p>
        
        <p>It can detect difference without declaring direction.</p>
        
        <p>It can describe constraint without prescribing correction.</p>
        
        <p>It can support auditing because the forbidden classes are categorical, not contextual.</p>
        
        <p>This framework forbids any operation that requires a notion of "better."</p>
        
        <p>It forbids any operation that requires a notion of "should."</p>
        
        <p>It forbids any operation that requires a stable model of a person.</p>
        
        <p>It forbids any operation that depends on outcome manipulation to justify its existence.</p>
        
        <p>The allowed space is narrow by design. The narrowness is the defense.</p>
        
        <p>If a future reader must determine whether a downstream system exceeded its authority under this doctrine, they do not need access to intent. They need only check whether the boundary from representation to steering was crossed.</p>

        <h2>8. Closing</h2>

        <p>It treats behavior as admissible and refuses identity as out of scope.</p>
